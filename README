Challenge: Mission to the Moon 

This project try to create an interconection between a drone and a rover. The drone give the map to the rover, to indicate where the rover needs to go. 

Open the drone simulation 
1. roscore
2. roslaunch cvg_sim_gazebo ardrone_testworld.launch
3. rosrun ardrone_autonomy ardrone_driver\

Basic Movements for a Drone
rostopic pub ardrone/takeoff std_msgs/Empty # Elevate
rostopic pub ardrone/land std_msgs/Empty # Land

Movements with Coordenates for a Drone
rostopic pub -1 /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist -- '[0.1,0.0,0.0]' '[0,0,0]' # Go 
rostopic pub -1 /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist -- '[0.0,0.0,0.0]' '[0,0,0]' # Stop
rostopic pub -1 /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist -- '[0.0,0.1,0.0]' '[0,0,0]' # Go right
rostopic pub -1 /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist -- '[0.0,0.0,0.1]' '[0,0,0]' # Up


Starting the simulation and the driver
rostopic pub ardrone/takeoff std_msgs/Empty
rosrun drone_controller takeoff.py


Open the rosaria simulation
When you had installed the two options: open the simulation or connect the rover to a serial port.

If you connect the rover to the serial port, you should bring a read permission to the usb port that generally is ttyUSB0.

**You can verify the usb port when you connect it to the computer and run the command dmesg**

Example:
sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0


To see the sonar information using rviz
1. rosrun rviz rviz
2. Run in other terminal:
rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 map sonar 100
3. Run in other terminal:
rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 map odom 100

To run Rosaria
1. roscore
**If you only have to open once*
2. In other terminal:
rosrun rosaria RosAria


Import drone to the moon:
Do the normal steps to open the simulation in the moon with the rover:
1.roscore
2. roslaunch amr_robots_gazebo example-pioneer3at-moonworld.launch

When Gazebo is open, go to edit>model editor> add> 
Find the drone file that while be in: 
	catkin>src> ardrone_simulator_gazebo7_cvg_sim_gazebo> meshes>quadrotor
Choose the model quadrotor_4.stl because the last version of the drone.

Close the model editor that is in the file, press save and close the simulation to save the changes in the quadrotor.
